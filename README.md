 ## CONTENT
 
For this project, imagine that the Institute for Public Policy has employed you to analyze and create a visualization as part of a larger initiative it’s working on. In this scenario, the institute believes that past events heavily influence the current geopolitical climate. To delve deeper into this hypothesis, a clearer understanding of the historical relationships between countries in the twentieth century is needed Suitable results can be achieved by looking to **major global events throughout the twentieth century** . 

To do so, you’ll need to give a **visualization and an analysis of the chain of events** that led to the current state of affairs.
To be effective, your visualization must highlight these past relationships. This way, other researchers can understand and tie your findings into the final report.

## DATA, TOOLS AND REQUIREMENTS 

 For this project, you’ll **scrape data from a web page (using Wikipedia)**, which will be the basis for the visual analysis in the report. As you’ll be looking for textual content, the data analysis will also involve text mining. 
 Once you have the data ready for your analysis, you’ll apply a basic natural language processing (NLP) algorithm to the collected data to extract a relationships mapfromit. As a final step, you’ll create a network analysis visualization for all the content you scraped and preprocessed.
 
 
### Data Sourcing Criteria

 ● Scrapealist of countries from a web page;
 
 ● Scrapeatwentieth-century history and politics page from Wikipedia.
 

### Analysis Criteria
 
 ● UseNLPtoanalyzethescraped content, compile a list of the countries involved in majortwentieth-century events, and document how they’re connected.
 
 ● Determinethe degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality of the countries in your
 graph.
 
 
### Visualization Criteria
 
 ● Createadynamicnetwork chart showing the interactions between the countries.
 
 ● Thechartclearly distinguishes between different relationships and communities in a
 network.
 
 
### Success Factors
 
 ● Presentapolished, dynamic chart that provides an overview of the interrelations between world powers in the twentieth century. Your visualization should be clear so that your client can understand the relationships between different countries during historical milestones, as the final report will be available for viewing by the public
